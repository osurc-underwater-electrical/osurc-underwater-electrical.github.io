The images are stored on a cloud CDN to reduce the size of repository but still provide a central location for image sources.

Use an html <img> tag to include an image from there like this (changing the src of course):

<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/kjbx6tb5231/default-image.jpg" alt="arch way" style="width:25%;height:100%">

It is also possible to use markdown format to include an image, but html will provide more customization an freedom when placing and sizing images.  The html <img> tag is the preferred format.
