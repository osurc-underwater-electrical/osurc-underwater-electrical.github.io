The images are stored on the ImageKit.io account to reduce the size of repository but still provide a central repository for image sources.

Use an html <img> tag to include an image from there like this (changing the src of course):

<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/ym3njxeyk4e/default-image.jpg" alt="box" style="width:25%;height:100%">

It is also possible to use markdown format to include an image, but html will provide more customization an freedom when placing and sizing images.  The html <img> tag is the preferred format.
