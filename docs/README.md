# Overview

Welcome the documentation for the Oregon State Robotics Club Undwater division Electrical team (OSURCue for short).  The goal of this documentation is simple: explain what we are doing, or have done to create functioning underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that can compete in competitions.

Currently, we are designing for the MATE ROV Competition. The competition website can be found [here](https://materovcompetition.org/).  More information about the competition specifications and how our robot is designed can be found in the 'Current Design' page, accessible via the sidebar.
