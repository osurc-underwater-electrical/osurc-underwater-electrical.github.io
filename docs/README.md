# Overview

The general format for the documentation is 

    - Overview
        + General Info 
    - Current Design
        + Getting Started (which takes you to the current design)


## Why this format?

The primary of goal of any documenation is to explain something.  In this case, we want to explain the design for the electrical components of the undwater ROV created for the OSU Robotics Underwater team.

It is also important to understand how the design has changed over time.  Consequently, it makes sense to split the documentation by year.  Additionally, if the design changes significantly between years---as it has in past, and will in the future---then each year is free to have its documents structured to best convey design intent.

If there are only a few changes between years, it should be a simple matter to copy files into a new folder for the new year and add the changes there.
